  <blockquote>
    <p>THAT the religious public of Scotland and of other lands is still interested in the
    life and work of M'Cheyne, is evident from the extensive sale which still goes on of Dr
    Andrew Bonar's <i>Memoir and Remains</i> of that saintly man. Since that book was first
    published, over 150,000 copies have been sold&#151;in addition to 50,000 of the <i>Memoir</i>
    without the <i>Remains</i>&#151;and it has been found in the most out-of-the-way
    farm-houses and shepherd huts of America and Australia. This little book is not intended
    even to supplement that religious classic, but just again&#151;though from a somewhat
    different standpoint&#151;to show forth the piety and zeal of a devoted minister of the
    Gospel. The <i>Memoir</i> by Dr. Bonar has stirred up many a minister to greater
    earnestness and usefulness, and we are hopeful that this volume&#151;which brings into
    prominence one of M'Cheyne's elders, and which is meant specially for laymen&#151;will, in
    these days of so much lay work for Christ, have a similar effect upon elders, deacons,
    Sabbath school teachers, and other works in the Master's vineyard. </p>

    <p>ROBERT MURRAY M'CHEYNE, born in Edinburgh, 21<sup>st</sup> May, 1813. Educated at High
    School and University there; gained distinction in his classes; Professor Wilson
    (&quot;Christopher North&quot;) awarded him the poetry prize. Studied theology under Dr.
    Chalmers. Licensed by the presbytery of Annan in 1835. Preached his first sermon in
    Ruthwell Church. Assistant for ten months to the Rev. John Bonar at Larbert. Ordained to
    St. Peter's Church, Dundee, on 24<sup>th</sup> November, 1836. Appointed in 1839 one of a
    deputation to visit Palestine, for the purpose of promoting a mission to the Jews. On his
    return to Dundee threw himself heart and soul into revival work in that town. Visited the
    north of Ireland twice, and imparted to the churches there a strong spiritual impulse.
    Went on an evangelistic tour of the north-east of Scotland, from which he returned much
    fatigued to his work in Dundee. Seized a few days after with typhus fever. Died 25<sup>th</sup>
