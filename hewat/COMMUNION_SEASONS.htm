  <p>A SCOTTISH Communion even yet differs considerably from other Communions, or methods of
  celebrating the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, in Protestant churches. Up to the
  beginning of the present century, and still later, it had features peculiarly striking. In
  country districts it was called &quot;The Holy Fair.&quot; Crowds gathered from all parts
  of the neighbouring parishes, and certainly in some cases unhallowed scenes were
  witnessed, unbecoming such a solemnity, and which the poet Burns exposed and satirized.
  These festivals came round twice a year, and to this day there are congregations in
  Scotland who do not observe the holy ordinance of the Supper oftener. </p>
  <p>When Mr. M'Cheyne came to Dundee the &quot;Holy Fair&quot; style of keeping the
  Communion had almost completely passed away, but the prolonged services of the Sabbath
  were still in vogue, as also lengthy week-day services, bearing on Communion. These
  week-day services were highly prized by the really pious, as rich means of grace. All the
  best men of the countryside were called upon to give out of their treasures things new and
  old. Now, in many cases, these services are discontinued, and instead not a few earnest
  evangelical ministers have substituted a series of special evangelistic meetings,
  preparatory to a Communion season. In St. Peter's all these service connected with the
  dispensation of the Holy sacrament were exceedingly precious and edifying. Mr. Lamb, in
  his diary, speaks of them as being sometimes long, but we shall see how he speaks of them
  as being greatly blessed to him and others. They were &quot;times of refreshing,&quot;
  &quot;days of heaven upon earth.&quot; </p>
  <p>It was M'Cheyne's practice to have two services on the Thursday, one on the Friday, and
  one on the Saturday before the Communion Sabbath, and a thanksgiving service on the
  Monday. In the celebration of the ordinance there were many table services, as only a
  comparatively small number could come forward at the same time, and the membership was
  large. At each table service fresh devotional exercises were engaged in, and fresh
  addresses delivered, involving a large expenditure of thought and labour, but these were
  cheerfully rendered by ministers from all parts of the country. Sunday was &quot;the great
  day of the feast.&quot; On that day, immense crowds assembled, with a large muster of
  ministers. Those who chiefly assisted M'Cheyne at these Communion seasons were the Rev.
  Andrew A. Bonar, the Rev. Robert Macdonald of Blairgowrie, and the Rev. James Grierson of
  Errol. All these attained to high distinction in the Church, and their memories are
  fragrant to this day. </p>
  <p>Mr. M'Cheyne introduced a more frequent celebration of the Sacrament, and arranged that
  it should be kept <i>four</i> times a year, which was regarded as an innovation then, but
  now it is quite common in Presbyterian churches to observe the Communion at least once a
  quarter, while in other churches it is celebrated once a month, and in some places once a
  week. </p>
  <p>It has already been said that the Communion services in St Peter's were largely
  attended, but those who came were not impelled by the motives that actuated many in the
  days of the &quot;Holy Fair;&quot; they were prompted rather by a spirit of deep
  earnestness, a hunger of the spiritual manna, and a longing for a closer walk with God. </p>
  <p>Here are some extracts from Wm. Lamb's diary as bearing on the Communion seasons in
  Dundee:- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, August 1, 1841. Sacrament Sabbath. Mr. M'Cheyne officiated, assisted by
    Mr. Andrew Bonar. The text was Colossians i. 21-23 : '<i>And you, that were sometime
    alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled</i>.' The
    church was full, many communicating, among whom were strangers drawn to St. Peter's by the
    fame of its minister. I rejoice that in St. Peter's parish we have now the Communion four
    times in the year. There can be no doubt that the early disciples, in the days of the
    Apostles, partook of this blessed ordinance frequently&#151;once a week,&#151;and it was
    then, as it is now, most blessed. Indeed, there is no service which Christ has commanded
    His followers to observe, more solemn, more heart-stirring, and more likely to keep alive
    our weak and wavering faith than that of the Holy Sacrament. </p>
    <p>&quot;Yet, how is it that I long so little for these seasons? Alas! I fear it is
    because the world, with its cares and lusts and anxieties, cools my love, weakens my
    faith, and draws me away from a crucified Saviour. I lament before Thee, O God, that since
    I last sat at the holy table, I have been lukewarm in all my religious duties; my prayers
    in the closet have been cold and formal, and often a very weariness in public, a mere
    worshipping with the lips, while my hearts has been wandering on the mountains of vanity.
    What is the cause of this? Some cherished idol still retained in my heart, some
    uncrucified lust or passion, some worldly pleasure not yet wholly surrendered? Unto Thee,
    O God, it is known! Do Thou show it unto me, that I may know these roots of bitterness
    which spring up and trouble me. O Heavenly Father, hide not Thy face from me! Restore unto
    me the joys of Thy salvation, and uphold me with Thy free Spirit. Make this day one of
    sweet blessing to my weary soul, and refresh me with Thy grace. </p>
    <p>Sabbath, October 31, 1841. On the day before the Communion we find these words;
    &quot;Endeavoured to pray to-day in secret, to lay open my heart to God, and confess my
    sins fully, unreservedly. May the Lord hear and grant me the sense of complete
    forgiveness, and may I go forward in Divine grace. It takes much prayer and much
    watchfulness to advance in the Christian life. There is no rest, if I am to grow. </p>
    <p>&quot;Rose at seven. Dressed, and thereafter had my private devotions, praying
    earnestly to be fitted for a Communion day.&quot; At eight o'clock he was at a prayer
    meeting of the Sabbath school children. Then in regard to the Communion service he writes:
    &quot;St. Peter's was very full to-day. Mr. M'Cheyne had a most suitable discourse from
    Romans viii. 35, '<i>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or
    distress,</i>' &amp;c. He showed that not one of all those things could or would separate
    a true believer from his Saviour. Even in this life, though ever fighting from day to day
    against outward temptations, and the still more formidable traitor from within a corrupt
    heart, yet we were more than conquerors through Him that loved us.&quot; Mr. Lamb notes
    that the dispensing of the Sacrament lasted from one o'clock till nearly seven o'clock in
    the evening. That was accounted for by the smallness of the tables, and the numbers
    pressing forward. </p>
    <p>&quot;Methinks in our church there is too much said about the Sacrament, so that the
    uneducated or more ignorant of our congregation, not clearly seeing that it is merely a <i>commemoration
    service</i>, to be held by those only who are of the body of Christ, are apt to think that
    there is some innate virtue in this ordinance, and that they must go to it. There is
    something needed in our church to put this right.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, April 17, 1842. Another Communion day. How they come and go! Oh that
    each as it comes round may be helpful in fitting me for the never-ending communion of
    heaven! Mr. M'Cheyne preached a most suitable discourse from 1 Cor. iii. 10-17, showing
    how ministers are compared to builders, putting lively stones only into the great
    spiritual temple, and that this was a most important work. They need to take heed how they
    build. Even the Apostles, though richly endowed with the Holy Spirit, failed in adding
    only gold and silver and precious stones (true believers), for they admitted into the
    Church a Demas. How much still do ministers need to watch and pray!&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We have variety in nature, why not in grace? Every day has not the same amount of
  sunshine in it, nor the same amount of rain. The measure is meted out by Him who is
  &quot;wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.&quot; Every Sabbath day is a day of
  rest and privilege, but as there are some stars brighter, and some flowers fairer, than
  others, so with our Communion Sabbaths. Some are remarkable days of blessing. It was so in
  the olden time when the feats came round, and it has been particularly so in connection
  with our Communion seasons in Scotland. And partly this was owing to the spirit of prayer
  and expectancy that was evoked, as will be seen from the following:- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, 16<sup>th</sup> October, 1842.&quot;&nbsp; Under this date Mr. Lamb
    refers to a &quot;concert of prayer&quot; which took place early in the morning. </p>
    <p>&quot;Mr. M'Cheyne preached in the morning from Romans i. 15-18, particularly these
    words, '<i>I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto
    salvation, to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</i>' At
    the close of the Communion he spoke from the following words (Rev. iii. 4), '<i>Thou has a
    few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with
    Me in white: for they are worthy.</i>' He spoke of the comfort it afforded a minister
    (angel), when he knew that he had some few names in his congregation who had not defiled
    their garments, and who would walk with Christ in white, because they were
    worthy&#151;worthy through Him who so loved them as to die for them, making their robes
    white in His atoning all-precious blood. </p>
    <p>&quot;The sermon in the morning struck me very forcible, showing how Paul was not
    ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, though it be foolishness to them that are wise in their
    own eyes, and despise such ministers as faithfully preach the Gospel, saying, as the
    Romans and Corinthians said of Paul, that they are contemptible, weak, and ignorant men:
    but so it will ever be&#151;'the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
    God.' </p>
    <p>&quot;In the past history of our church Communion season have been peculiarly
    refreshing and strengthening to the people of God; but they have also been seasons of
    conversion, and they will always be, so long as the Word is faithfully preached among us. </p>
    <p>&quot;During the service it struck me that the minister was much aided by the Divine
    Spirit, both in his prayers and in his preaching. He seemed to come forth in the 'fulness
    of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ;' and I have no doubt the Word spoken was carried
    home with power, while it could not fail to have comforted and edified the children of
    God. It was gratifying to hear of some of the relatives of the minister&#151;three young
    ladies&#151;who had for the first time joined the church, giving themselves up openly at
    the sacramental table to Him who loved them, and gave Himself to redeem them from sin and
    death. Until lately, I understand, they were living entirely for the world, dead to all
    spiritual things; but now it has pleased God to reveal His Son in them.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The ladies referred to are evidently those mentioned in a delightful booklet by the
  Rev. J. Moffat Scott, entitle, &quot;A MODERN SAINT ; or Three Lectures on the Rev. R. M.
  M'Cheyne.&quot; To illustrate the remarkable tact and prudence of M'Cheyne, Mr. Scott
  narrates the following, his informant being the late Rev. James Dodds, of Dunbar. In
  August, 1842, M'Cheyne paid a visit to some friends in Dumfriesshire, among whom were
  three young ladies, gay and accomplished, but destitute of vital godliness, and hostile to
  evangelical religion. They jauntily dubbed the clerical friend <i>Perfection</i>, and
  hardened their hearts against his fascinations. But M'Cheyne completely surprised and
  captivated them. Happy, hearty, gentlemanly, he speedily convinced them that religion was
  not a galling and enslaving yoke; and by his tender, affectionate manner he swiftly won
  their confidence. All were delighted with him, and much interested in his conversation.
  They walked about with him, and entered cottages where he prayed. During prayer one day,
  the gayest of the sisters sobbed aloud; and after family worship, one evening, the others
  burst into tears, crying out about sin. Their pride was broken; their hearts were melted;
  they saw things in a new light, and thirsted for instruction. All became decided and
  earnest Christians, adorning domestic life with Christian graces; and long after M'Cheyne
  had gone to the saints' everlasting rest, they told that it was their cousin's sympathetic
  spirit and pitiful look that struck them down. </p>
  <p>M'Cheyne's was indeed a winsome personality. Along with a cultured and poetic mind he
  possessed a lithe and athletic frame, delighting in physical exercise. Dr. Guthrie indeed
  said that his love for gymnastics had something to do with his death, for one day, at the
  manse of Errol, after breakfast, noticing some gymnastic poles in the garden, he rushed to
  a horizontal bar resting on the forks of two upright ones, and went through a series of
  athletic evolutions. He then challenged Dr. Guthrie to do the like; but when about to make
  the attempt, suddenly the pole, on which M'Cheyne was hanging by his heels, snapped
  asunder, and he fell to the ground with great violence. &quot;He sickened,&quot; adds Dr.
  Guthrie, &quot;was borne into the manse, and lay there for several days, and was never the
  same man again.&quot; </p>
  <p>But to resume the diary. About this time, 1842, Mr. Lamb went to Blairgowrie, and
  partook of the Holy Supper there; and here is what he says regarding it. &quot;I felt that
  there was a want of solemnity about the whole service, both on the part of ministers and
  people; too much noise; rising and going out in the very middle of the services. It was
  quite painful and annoying. This is the first time I have communicated in a country
  parish, and the manner of conducting the service presented a marked contrast to the
  solemnity and quietness observed on such occasions in St. Peter's. Had the mode of
  conducting the sacramental services within the church been at all in keeping, as I had
  hoped, with the stillness and grandeur of nature without, then how solemn and impressive
  they would have been! Nevertheless, I trust the Lord was there, comforting and edifying
  His people, giving new faith, and filling them with joy and peace in believing.&quot; </p>
  <p>Whether Mr. M'Cheyne had a presentiment of his early death it is not said, but as his
  end drew near he appeared to be increasingly earnest. Every Sabbath day was more or less
  remarkable for the fervency of spirit he showed in his preaching and in his prayers, but
  special preparation seems to have been made for the Communion days. These were
  emphatically high days in St. Peter's, as the following quotations from the diary will
  show. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, January 1<sup>st</sup>, 1843. Communion day in St. Peter's. Mr. M'Cheyne
    preached from 1 Timothy i. 16: '<i>Howbeit for this cause I received mercy, that in me
    first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should
    hereafter believe on Him to life everlasting.</i>' The discourse was excellent, showing
    that if in such as Paul&#151;the persecutor, blasphemer, and impious&#151;Jesus Christ
    showed forth the long-suffering of His grace, making it sufficient to save <i>him</i>, was
    it not sufficient to save any of us, though the chief of sinners? One reason why Paul
    obtained mercy was that he might be a <i>pattern</i> to them who should hereafter believe
    in Him to life everlasting. God must tell us over and over again that He is a God of
    mercy, and willeth not the death of any. But that would not suffice so well as a <i>pattern</i>.
    Let a pattern or example be seen, and people will understand it at once. </p>
    <p>&quot;Paul was a pattern before his conversion. There was an instance of the <i>sovereignty
    of God</i> in this that Jesus Christ came to <i>men</i>, and not to <i>angels</i>. 'He
    took not on Him the nature of angels.' Moreover, for ages God passed over the Gentile
    world. He loved Jacob and hated Esau. But in the fulness of the times His Gospel was sent
    to the Gentiles also. One of the most remarkable proofs however, of the Doctrine of Divine
    sovereignty is the case of Paul&#151;who had been taught at the feet of the Jewish doctors
    to hate Jesus, and was encouraged to become the fiery persecutor of the Lord's followers.
    Who would have thought that God would have chosen <i>him</i>&#151;the chief of
    sinners&#151;to be His great instrument in promoting Christianity? What a pattern or
    example of God's sovereign ways in dealing with the children of men! </p>
    <p>&quot;Had Paul been told on the morning that he set out to persecute the saints at
    Damascus, that God would meet him and make him willing to propagate the new faith he was
    so despising and endeavouring to destroy root and branch, he would have laughed a scornful
    laugh. Lydia was also an instance of the sovereignty of God, but not such a pattern as
    Paul was. As the Psalmist said, 'Blessed is the man whom Thou choosest, and causest to
    approach Thee.' God makes people willing in the day of His power. This is 'effectual
    calling,' a calling which lays hold of all the affections, and changes the whole current
    of the mind. </p>
    <p>&quot;Paul was also a pattern of <i>justification by the righteousness of Another</i>.
    We may say that if ever there was a man whose salvation seemed impossible by the
    righteousness of another, that man was Paul. He had already provided himself with a
    righteousness of his own. 'As touching the law he was blameless.' All rites and ceremonies
    he most earnestly observed. Yet all that he gave up and cast aside, and by the
    righteousness of Christ became righteous. In himself he was nothing; in Christ he was
    everything. </p>
    <p>&quot;But again, Paul was a pattern to all men <i>after his conversion</i>. Before, he
    was the chief of sinners; after, he became the chief of saints, not a whit behind the
    chief of the Apostles. He lived a life of faith and holiness. He walked by faith, and not
    by sight. He was not only saved from sin, but saved to be holy. When really saved, we
    cannot live in any sin. Then Paul was a pattern <i>in his labours for the Lord</i>, in his
    preaching for Him, and in his witnessing for Him. </p>
    <p>&quot;Two lessons were drawn from this subject. (1.) <i>Those who have been saved must
    be patterns</i>: patterns to their families, to their neighbours, to those who should
    thereafter believe in Him to life everlasting. We are not saved just for our own sake, or
    for our own comfort, but to be patterns. We must tell out what great things the Lord hath
    done for us. (2.) Sinners unsaved are quite inexcusable; for if Paul, who was the chief of
    sinners, a blasphemer, a persecutor, was saved, may not all obtain mercy?&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is difficult to say at what stages in the Communion service Mr. M'Cheyne uttered the
  following words, but likely they were spoken in connection with the actual celebration of
  the ordinance. &quot;Philippians iii. 3: '<i>Rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no
  confidence in the flesh.</i>' You are not to look at your conduct for your peace, but to
  Him in whom we are accepted. What sins and shortcomings we have to bewail! But in Him
  there was no sin, and we are complete in Him. Hebrews vi. 18: '<i>We have a strong
  consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.</i>' Think
  of Jesus Christ and His atoning work as your city of refuge. Psalm cxix. 5: '<i>O that my
  ways were directed to keep Thy statutes!</i>' This is the cry of a new creature. No
  unregenerate man can say this. Are you willing to be entirely holy? Are you willing to
  part with all sin? Your fleshly pleasures? Your drunkenness? Your effeminacy? Are you
  willing to give of your money to the Lord? Ah, some poor soul cries out&#151;Impossible!
  Iniquities prevail against me! Lord, Thou knowest all things. It must be heaven to be
  holy. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The parting exhortation at the close of the Communion service was from Romans
    viii. 13: 'For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do
    mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.' In the course of this address he threw out
    a number of well-known texts which were likely to suit the necessities of all his hearers,
    such as 'Call upon Me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify
    Me.' 'Continue in the faith, and know that it is through much tribulation that we enter
    into the kingdom of God.' And then, in closing, with all tenderness he said to those who
    still remained careless, 'Despisest thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and
    long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.'&quot;</p>
