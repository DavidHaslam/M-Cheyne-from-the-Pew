          Saturdays that his heart might be thrilled by what he saw, and that he might be put into
          an arrested and serious frame for Sabbath work.&quot;</font> </p>

  <hr>
  <p>ST. PETER'S was a veritable bee-hive of industry when M'Cheyne was minister there. We
  have seen how he had sometimes more than two regular services in the church on the
  Sabbath, and how faithful and unwearied he was in the preaching of the everlasting Gospel;
  but this saintly man, who was an indefatigable worker himself, also had the gift or power
  of getting others to work devotedly along with him. There was a great deal of personal
  magnetism about M'Cheyne. He soon surrounded himself with a large band of office-bearers,
  and their motto must certainly have been: <i>To every man his work.</i> </p>
  <p>In addition to the elders, there was a large staff of tract distributors, who met at
  stated intervals for the reading of the Word and prayer. Then there was a great deal of
  work carried on among the young. Mr. Lamb had a class for adults, and so had M'Cheyne
  himself. There were large Sabbath schools, and, in addition, something like what we would
  now call a children's church, which, however, did not meet during the canonical hours of
  public worship, nor shortly before, but as early as eight o'clock in the morning. There
  are many references to this last in the diary. Now-a-days many congregations have more
  agencies at work than St. Peter's had, but undoubtedly this congregation, fifty years ago,
  must have held quite a unique place in Scotland for the number of its Christian
  enterprises, and the number of its workers; and we may look upon it as the pioneer of
  those latter-day great working congregations, of which we have conspicuous examples in
  Edinburgh and Glasgow. </p>
  <p>M'Cheyne himself took a deep personal and practical interest in all the agencies
  carried on. We have mentioned the meeting as early as eight o'clock in the morning; but
  there were meetings late as well as early. In a letter to Mr. Lamb, eight o'clock in the
  morning indicates how difficult it s to find time for the various meetings, and suggests
  that one of them be held at a quarter-past nine on the Thursday evening, and
  &quot;regularly&quot; at that late hour. It is interesting to find on one of M'Cheyne's
  envelops his crest or seal. It is that of the sun setting behind a mountain top, with the
  motto, &quot;The night cometh.&quot; How very appropriate to such an earnest worker for
  the Lord, to whom every moment was precious, and who was deeply impressed with the Lord's
  words: &quot;Work while it is called to-day, for <i>the night cometh</i>, when no man can
  work.&quot; </p>
  <p>He seems to have been specially interested in the Sabbath schools. Mr. Lamb writes in
  his diary: &quot;Had a visit of Mr. M'Cheyne, who addressed the children for a short
  time.&quot; Again, &quot;Attended a short address by Mr. M'Donald (of Blairgowrie,
  afterwards Dr. M'Donald, of North Leith) to the Sabbath school children in the evening,
  which was very appropriate and good.&quot; But from the context it is evident M'Cheyne was
  along with Mr. M'Donald, for Mr. Lamb adds, &quot;after this we had a prayer meeting, Mr.
  M'Cheyne and another minister officiating.&quot; </p>
  <p>Then we find from the diary that this devoted minister had a course of special lectures
  for Sabbath school teachers. It is evident, however, that he did not give the first place
  to mere <i>head</i> knowledge or intellectual ability, for there is a letter from him to
  Mr. Lamb in which he mentions to young women who &quot;were very humble, prudent, and
  consistent Christians, and very anxious to be Sabbath school teachers. They have not much
  education, but they have much grace.&quot; He then asks Mr. Lamb to try and find an
  opening for them &quot;in our present schools, or any district peculiarly needing another
  girls' school. Failing these, he suggests they might gather together children of still
  younger age, and &quot;try the infant school system in Sabbath schools.&quot; </p>
  <p>M'Cheyne took an interest in the praise of the sanctuary, and would have no bad or
  slovenly singing. Here is a brief extract from the diary in this connection: &quot;Mr.
  M'Cheyne intimated to-day that there would be weekly meetings for singing, and that it was
  a great shame that Christians did not endeavour to sing the praise of God well. Why should
  the devil, as one remarked, have all the best music? This is very true,&quot; adds Mr.
  Lamb, &quot;and I rejoice that he has mentioned the subject.&quot; </p>
  <p>Every one knows of M'Cheyne's interest in the Jews, and how he went on a &quot;mission
  of inquiry&quot; to Palestine to see what could be done to bring the light of the Gospel
  to bear upon them in their own land. But to other parts of the world, where heathenism
  prevailed, his gaze was also directed. In other words, he took a deep interest in Foreign
  Missions. Here is an entry in the diary bearing on this:- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Thursday, 2<sup>nd</sup> June, 1842. At weekly prayer meeting in church as usual.
    Mr. M'Cheyne communicated some interesting intelligence from a young missionary at the
    Azores, and gave a very excellent and comforting address from the words of Isaiah xlv. 22:
    '<i>Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.</i>'&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It was only to be expected that wherever there were revival times M'Cheyne would
  rejoice to look in that direction. So at another prayer meeting we have this: &quot;Mr.
  M'Cheyne communicated some interesting information regarding a revival of religion in
  England,&quot; and, adds the diary, which shows how humble he was, and how he felt his own
  unworthiness, &quot;He lamented his deadness!&quot; <i>M'Cheyne's</i> deadness! The whole
  Church would be the better of more of <i>such</i> &quot;deadness!&quot; </p>
  <p>At another prayer meeting in the church, where the non-intrusion controversy was
  raging, M'Cheyne laid great stress on Church reformation, and he emphasized the following:
  (1) Reformation in the doctrines preached. Let preachers preach up to the standards of the
  Church, and not below them. Let dead preaching come to an end. (2) Reformation in the
  lives of ministers, preaching more by their holy and consistent lives than in their
  sermons. (3) Reformation in discipline, specially as regards admittance to the Lord's
  table. Many are admitted who have not a creditable profession, who are lacking in
  knowledge, and whose lives are not worthy. (4) Reformation as regards the appointment of
  ministers. Patronage must be abolished, as inconsistent with God's Word. </p>
  <p>In those days the Church of Scotland would not open its pulpits to ministers of other
  denominations. But M'Cheyne evidently had no sympathy with such narrowness, so
  whenever&#151; owing to a change in the ecclesiastical law&#151;he could have a brother of
  another communion preaching for him, he availed himself of the opportunity. Accordingly we
  have the following extract in the diary: &quot;Afternoon (in St. Peter's) Mr. Borwick, of
  the Secession Church, preached from Luke ix. 29-31. How pleasing to see these barriers of
  party Christians broken down, and the right hand of fellowship held out by one Christian
  Church to the members and ministers of others. Methinks if the General Assembly this year
  (1842) had done nothing else save repealing that obnoxious law, which prevented its
  ministers asking other evangelical men to preach in their churches, it had done much. In
  the midst of trouble and internal struggles in the Church of Scotland, this is a pleasing
  and refreshing thing. Surely in the midst of our bondage God is reviving us a
  little.&quot; </p>
