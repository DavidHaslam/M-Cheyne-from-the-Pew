  <blockquote>
    <p>ON the third day of April, 1895, at Prestwick, Ayrshire, there passed away, at the age
    of 82, John Robert Lamb. He was a grain merchant in Glasgow, and as a mark of the high
    esteem in which he was held in that city, he received, on attaining his jubilee as a
    merchant, an illuminated address; while some time before there was conferred on him, by
    the German Emperor, the Order of the Red Eagle, in recognition of his valuable services as
    Prussian Consul in Glasgow for nearly a quarter of a century. In the cause of Christ he
    acted as an office-bearer in various churches, and rendered long and signal service. </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When a young man he spent some time in Dundee, where he attended the ministry of the
    Rev. Robert Murray M'Cheyne. Among his cherished possessions was a bookcase, which at one
    time belonged to that devoted minister. He also frequently spoke of his brother William,
    who for some years acted as an elder and Christian worker in M'Cheyne's congregation, and
    who kept a diary containing a detailed account of the operations carried on in St. Peter's
    Church. This diary was left to a son in Glasgow, who most kindly gave me a perusal of it.
    At once it was evident that in this diary&#151;there was preserved a most valuable record
    of Christian work that ought to be published, a view in which a number of friends
    concurred to whom the diary was shown. It covers a period longer than that in which
    M'Cheyne exercised his ministry in Dundee, but we shall confine our attention to those
    years in which Mr. Lamb enjoyed the ministrations and fellowship of that holy man of God. </p>

    <p>Enclosed within the leaves of the diary are several autograph letters written by Mr.
    M'Cheyne, one of which will be reproduced in this book. </p>

  <p>It may be interesting to know something of the history of him who wrote the diary. </p>

  <p align="center"><big><strong>WILLIAM LAMB. </strong></big></p>
  <p>He was born at Leith on the 28<sup>th</sup> day of May, 1815. His father was a
  solicitor, while an uncle occupied the honourable position of the Provost of the town.
  When a boy he was sent to the Edinburgh Academy, and among his contemporaries were some
  who rose to high distinction, such as Archibald Campbell Tait, who became Archbishop of
  Canterbury. Leaving the academy, he went to Germany, where he spent two years at school,
  then proceeded to Norway, where he remained for about a year. </p>
  <p>It would appear that his guardians (for his father died when William was only three
  years of age) intended him for a mercantile life, and therefore regarded the acquisition
  of modern languages as most important. This training was found to be exceedingly useful,
  not only in business, but in working for God among foreign sailors. After serving his
  apprenticeship in Leith he went to London, where he remained from July, 1839 to April,
  1840, when he came to Dundee, and commenced business as a grain merchant and shipper. </p>
  <p>It was under the ministry of the Rev. James Buchanan, of North Leith, afterwards
  Professor Buchanan of Edinburgh New College, that he was brought under saving impressions.
  He had been brought up, however, as an Episcopalian, and had been confirmed by Bishop
  Sandford. </p>
  <p>On coming to Dundee he at once decided to attend St. Peter's; and it was not long till
  he became one of the tract distributors, then a Sabbath school teacher, and in course of
  time was appointed superintendent. He also had an adult Bible class. Subsequently he was
  ordained an elder, and acted as session clerk. Outside the church he also rendered good
  service among German sailors, conducting worship and preaching the Gospel in their own
  tongue. A beautiful feature in his character was his remarkable freedom from bigotry and
  his delight in holding fellowship with all evangelical Churches. </p>
  <p>Mr. Lamb married in 1845, but his married life, though exceedingly happy, was
  comparatively short. After the birth of their second child his wife passed away, as the
  result of an illness that lasted only four days. This was felt to be a great blow, but was
  borne with Christian resignation, in the assurance that his Heavenly Father was doing it
  all for the best. And, remarkable enough, he himself followed in the course of the same
  year, as we shall see farther on. </p>
  <p>Glancing over the diary, it is evident that while Mr. Lamb was a lover of good men, he
  was also a lover of Nature. He delighted to make visits to the country, away &quot;from
  the madding crowd.&quot; &quot;How I love,&quot; he said, &quot;the green fields and
  murmuring brooks! 'God made the country, and man made the town.'&quot; He also found time
  for recreation, in fishing, or shooting, or having a round of golf on St. Andrews links.
  There was nothing mawkish or effeminate about his religion. He added to his faith
  manliness. Like his minister, M'Cheyne, he frequently took exercise on horseback. A good
  gallop into the country was to him a great delight. </p>
  <p>One day, however, while riding on the Fife side of the Tay, he suddenly stopped his
  horse to speak to a friend, when something caused the animal to shy. He was thrown to the
  ground. His head was severely bruised, and he was lifted up unconscious. He never spoke
  again. After eighteen hours of unconsciousness he died. The silver cord was loosed, and
  the golden bowl was broken. All too early, at the age of thirty-three, the Saviour's age,
  he passed away. Yet in his comparatively short life he had lived so much, allowing no
  talent to remain unused, and no opportunity of serving his Master, the Lord Jesus Christ,
  to pass away unimproved. </p>
  <p>So tragical an end to a life of such usefulness, and to a career of such promise,
  produced a profound sensation in the community; and we close this brief sketch by
  transcribing the minute that was framed by his fellow office-bearers in the church,
  expressing the high esteem in which he was held. The minute is dated 8<sup>th</sup>
  November, 1848, and is signed by the moderator, Islay Burns. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The kirk session have again to record, with emotions of deepest solemnity and
    grief, a great and heavy chastisement of Almighty God, sustained by the session and
    congregation of St. Peter's, since their last meeting, in the affecting and untimely
    removal by a fatal accident of Mr. William Lamb, one of their body, and the clerk of this
    court. </p>
    <p>&quot;In the bloom of youthful vigour, in the freshness of early zeal and opening
    usefulness in the cause of his Lord and Saviour, and at the very moment when, prepared by
    a season of peculiarly solemn and sanctifying discipline, he promised to be more than ever
    a comfort to the Church of Christ, of which he was an office-bearer, he has been, in the
    inscrutable providence of God, suddenly snatched away. </p>
    <p>&quot;The session, while remembering with joy the brief but bright career of their
    departed brother, and desiring meekly to bow before the sovereign counsels of Him whose
    ways are in the sea, and whose footsteps are not known, cannot but regard this
    dispensation, taken in connection with other recent events of a similar kind, as conveying
    a lesson of peculiar solemnity to this session and congregation, and constituting a loud
    call to search and try our ways, to humble ourselves deeply before God, and with all our
    hearts to return to Him from whom we have so deeply revolted. </p>
    <p>&quot;They desire most tenderly to sympathize with the afflicted relatives and orphan
    children of the departed in their present sore bereavement, and it is their earnest prayer
    that the God of all grace and consolation would not only minister needful consolation
    under this visitation of His providence, but sanctify and bless it to all concerned, so
    that what for the present is not joyous but grievous, may yet afterwards bring forth the
    pleasant fruits of righteousness, and form the means of spiritual blessing to many.&quot; </p>
