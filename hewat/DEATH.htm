  <hr>
  <p>W<small>E</small> now reach a time when all Dundee was saddened by the news that
  M'Cheyne was no more. In the diary occurs this entry: &quot;Sabbath, 12<sup>th</sup> March
  1843. Forenoon and afternoon at St. Peter's, Mr. M'Cheyne preached from Hebrews ix. 12,13:
  'Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood, He entered in once into
  the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. For if the blood of bulls and
  goats, and the ashes of an heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of
  the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ,' &amp;c.; and from Romans ix. 22,
  &quot;What if God, willing to show His wrath, and to make His power known, endured with
  much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction.' These were the last texts
  from which he preached.&quot; </p>
  <p>Two days after he was laid low with typhus fever. Who preached on the Sabbath
  immediately following, the diary does not tell us, but to one lamenting to M'Cheyne that
  he was unable to be in the pulpit that day the invalid said, &quot;I am preaching the
  sermon that God would have me do.&quot; While the fever raged he prayed much, and this was
  one of his prayers: &quot;<i>This</i> parish, Lord; this people, this whole place! Holy
  Father, keep through Thine own name those whom Thou hast given me.&quot; </p>
  <p>On the morning of Saturday, the twenty fifth March, 1843, he passed away&#151;only
  twenty-nine years of age. In the article of death his hands were uplifted as if
  pronouncing the benediction. Under this date Mr. Lamb has the following: &quot;A day of
  sad mourning in St. Peter's parish, the Rev. Robert M'Cheyne having died this morning at
  half-past 9 o'clock, after 12 days' illness, of typhus fever. The whole parish is a
  'Bochim,' and sorrow is depicted but too visibly in the countenances of those who knew him
  and sat in St. Peter's church. How strange are God's dealings! Those are taken whom we
  would think ought to have been left. This is a most solemn affliction to his people, and
  we need grace to bear it, and that it may be sanctified to us. In the evening there was a
  meeting in the church. The Rev. Andrew Bonar prayed and spoke a few words, and the whole
  assembly seemed bathed in tears, many sobbing aloud for grief. It was a sad sight, the
  saddest sight I have ever witnessed here. I looked often to the pulpit, and thought it is
  empty to-night: where is he now, who so often spoke from it, warning the careless, and
  comforting and edifying believers? He is gone before, and is near the throne, singing the
  song of Moses and the Lamb.&quot; </p>
  <p>The next day. &quot;Sabbath, 26<sup>th</sup> March. Rose at 7.30 o'clock. Dressed and
  devoted half-an-hour to secret reading and prayer. Felt much solemnized this morning, and
  was enabled to pray with much fulness. At St. Peter's; Andrew Bonar officiated. In the
  forenoon he preached from Romans viii. 38,39, 'For I am persuaded that neither death, nor
  life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, not things to come,
  nor height, nor death, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love
  of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' The discourse was most suitable to us in the
  present afflicting circumstances, showing clearly that all those things could not separate
  us from the love of God, that is, take <i>away God's love</i> to believers in Christ
  Jesus. Mr. Bonar said he took these words as a ground of comfort to himself. Whatever
  changes take place here, God's love remains the same to His people&#151;as the mountains
  stand round about Jerusalem, and always cast the same shadow on the Temple. He warned his
  hearers, however, that <i>unconverted</i> men might be separated from that love at any
  moment. He alluded to what Mr. M'Cheyne often said from the pulpit to the
  unconverted&#151; that he would be a witness against them&#151;and he added, that when he
  was very ill, and the fever laying firm hold of him, he prayed from them&#151;the
  unconverted&#151;and also for the people of God. In the afternoon Mr. Bonar preached from
  the same chapter, the 28<sup>th</sup> verse, 'And we know that all things work together
  for good to them that love God.' Among other things he said that it is consoling to know
  that afflictions are needed to conform the children of God to the image of His Son: that
  those that are called are called to be sanctified as well as justified.&quot; </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Evening, at my Sabbath school. Departed from the lessons to-night, and read Mr.
    M'Cheyne's last year's address to the <i>lambs of the flock</i>, and spoke a few words
    with reference to the writer's death. May of the children wept, and I could not help
    mingling tears with my first prayers for these 'lambs' of the clock of our dear, departed
    pastor, who so carefully tended them and loved them. Oh that his prayers for them might be
    answered, even this night! I felt much enabled to pray earnestly for this. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;After closing the school I visited Miss C. and conducted family worship there. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;This has been the saddest Sabbath that has yet dawned on St. Peter's. Hitherto
    God seems to have smiled on this part of His vineyard, and blessed His servant's work
    much. To-day many, many entered His courts with the 'spirit of heaviness,' and felt as if
    God were hiding His face from them, chastening us sorely, though in love. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Little did we think on the last Sabbath (12<sup>th</sup> March) that when Mr.
    M'Cheyne preached, and in his prayer several times at the end said, 'Come, Lord Jesus,
    come quickly,' that his prayer was so soon to be answered. He has entered upon the eternal
    Sabbath, the rest that remaineth for the people of God.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The following is an account of the services on the Sabbath after the funeral:- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, 2<sup>nd</sup> April, 1843. Long before the hour for worship the church
    was filled, and many of the congregation were shut out, so much that the Rev. Alexander
    Somerville of Glasgow was asked to preach in the churchyard. Mr. Roxburgh preached in the
    church from Philip. iii. 21. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Along with many others of the congregation I was outside, and joined in the worship
  there. Mr. Somerville, standing but a few paces from the new grave of our departed pastor,
  engaged in the usual way by praise and prayer, which, in the particular place and
  circumstances, I felt very solemn, more so than had I been inside. Mr. Somerville read I
  Cor. xv. (on the Resurrection), and preached from Rev. xv. 2,3. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;What a solemn meeting, thought I, surrounding the grave of our dear pastor, who
    but a few days since conducted our devotions! His voice is now silent on earth, and others
    fill his place. 'Frail man, his days are like the grass.' Mr. Somerville preached in the
    afternoon from Heb. iv. 14-16, a most suitable discourse, full of comfort, and warning to
    improve the solemn affliction aright. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Alex. G. with me to tea, and accompanied me to Sabbath school. Read Mr.
    M'Cheyne's <i>Reasons Why Children Should Flee to Christ</i>, and spoke a short time
    urging that on them. A. G. also addressed them, and the older scholars seemed a good deal
    impressed. Oh that some may this night have fled to Jesus Christ! </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Called together at Miss C.'s, and remained to family worship with them, thus
    closing this solemn Sabbath.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The following extracts from the diary doubtless will also prove interesting to many,
  and with them we say farewell to Mr. Lamb's M.S. volumes, the perusal of which has been a
  source of great delight and profit to ourselves:- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Tuesday, 4<sup>th</sup> April, 1843. Went to Edinburgh; called on Miss M'Cheyne
    to offer my condolence under the late severe affliction, the death of her worthy brother
    and my pastor; found he much composed and upheld; referred to the sacrifice she and her
    parents had made in consenting to leave his remains at St. Peter's, which had gratified us
    all so much, and would, I said, prove afterwards, though a sacrifice, a pleasing one even
    to themselves.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Later again in the year Mr. Lamb writes:- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Was lad to meet Miss M'Cheyne there (at Blairgowrie), and had much pleasant
    conversation during the evening regarding St. Peter's parish, and here beloved brother,
    the late pastor. Though pleasant our meeting, it recalled past scenes which reminded me of
    him gone to his rest, and cast a pleasing melancholy over my whole thoughts, Such, thought
    I, is this earthly scene&#151;all passing away&#151;none abiding&#151;and those we would
    most fondly keep here are often taken soonest away.&quot; </p>
