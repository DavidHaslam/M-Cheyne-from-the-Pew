  <p>IT was in the spring of 1840 that Mr. Lamb returned from London to Dundee. His
  intention was to settle in that busy town, and carry on business there as a grain
  merchant. As to where he was to worship on the Lord's Day, and receive help in the
  cultivation of a Christian life, he mad his mind so far made up that he should go to St.
  Peter's, where the Rev. Robert Murray M'Cheyne preached, and whose fame as a young,
  evangelical minister was rapidly increasing. Many flocked to this church because they felt
  they got a blessing in it. The preaching came &quot;with power,&quot; because manifestly
  with &quot;the unction of the Holy One.&quot; And what a joy it is to come under the
  quickening and refreshing influence of a living preacher, a true man of God, whose face,
  like the face of Moses, shines as if fresh from the holy mount! </p>
  <p>This was clearly the experience of William Lamb, as can be seen from the following
  notes from his diary:- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Friday, 3<sup>rd</sup> April, 1840. Arrived at Dundee from London after a good
    and safe passage of 41 hours. On the Sabbath following, in the morning, accompanied by my
    brother John, I went to Mr. Roxburgh's church, where we heard a very good lecture on
    Paul's conversion. In the afternoon we went to St. Peter's church, Mr. M'Cheyne's, where
    there was a delightful service, and the text was Jeremiah xxxi. 31, 32, '<i>Behold, the
    days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and
    the house of Judah</i>,' &amp;c. I greatly enjoyed the preaching. Before leaving London I
    had heard of M'Cheyne's zeal and work for Christ's cause, and entertained a presentiment
    that I would worship with him, and sit under his ministry. But now that I have heard him
    myself I am satisfied. I shall try to get a sitting in the church, and God grant that I
    may derive much strength from the ministrations of His servant. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Sunday, 12<sup>th</sup> April, 1840. Forenoon and afternoon attended St. Peter's,
    and was much gratified with M'Cheyne's sermons. He is so feeling and so practical. It was
    a great Sabbath to me. I could not help observing the contrast&#151;the peaceful quiet of
    Dundee as compared with the bustle of London. Peace of every kind contributes to
    devotional feeling.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Not many days elapsed before Mr. Lamb felt desirous of becoming a member of M'Cheyne's
  increasing flock. Under this date he says : &quot;I have become a member of St. Peter's,
  and for the first time have partaken of the Holy Sacrament there. I pray that my joining
  such a congregation, under the ministry of such a zealous and indefatigable servant of
  Christ, may prove of great spiritual benefit to my soul. How beautifully affectionate were
  M'Cheyne's addresses! He <i>draws</i> you to Christ. To-day he said, 'Christ has brought
  us into green pastures and by still waters, but would we follow the Shepherd into deep
  valleys of affliction and trial?' Ah ! true, it is easy to follow Christ when the way is <i>smooth</i>,
  but very different when the world&#151;worldly desires, pursuits, and pleasures are in our
  way, as stones and traps which make us stumble. I felt composed and comforted, though
  downcast, because of my walking too much away from Christ. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, 30<sup>th</sup> August, 1840. Forenoon and afternoon at St. Peter's. Mr.
    M'Cheyne preached in the forenoon from Hebrew i. 13, 14 verses, '<i>But to which of the
    angels said He at any time, Sit on My right hand, until I make thine enemies thy
    footstool? Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall
    be heirs of salvation?</i>' In the afternoon his text was Revelation xxi. 6-9, '<i>And He
    said to me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega,</i>' &amp;c. Was much pleased with both
    discourses. He also expounded the parable of the Ten Virgins, showing that between real
    Christians and mere nominal professors there is little <i>outward</i> difference. At
    length, however, the difference appears in the discovery of the fact that while real
    Christians have 'oil' of grace in the heart, mere professors have none.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>About this time Mr. Lamb speaks of a young friend, Mr. John S&#151;&#151;, who came
  from Glasgow to visit him, and who, on being taken to St. Peter's, was much impressed and
  blessed. He was greatly arrested by the preacher's earnestness, and by the striking
  similes that were used to illustrate and enforce the truth. Indeed it would appear that
  Mr. Lamb made it a point to take all his friends to St. Peter's. Having been himself so
  often refreshed at this &quot;well of salvation&quot; he was anxious that all his friends
  should share in a similar blessing. &quot;I took my friends to St. Peter's, and all were
  pleased with M'Cheyne. He was, however, weak in body, having just recovered from an
  illness.&quot; </p>
  <p>This evidently drew out the sympathies of Mr. Lamb for his minister, and led him to
  abound in prayer on his behalf. And in his diary he makes this remark, that &quot;all
  Church members might well lay to heart to pray for their minister. This was Paul's
  request, and it is the request of every true minister of Christ. 'Brethren, pray for us.'
  It is only on the Sabbath I seem to remember our minister. But this is not sufficient, for
  in proportion as a minister is prayed for by his people, so will he be more strengthened
  for his duties among them. We seem to think that the minister should pray for us (and no
  doubt rightly), but we should be more anxious to pray for him, for then he will not fail
  to be blessed in his work. For my part I feel that without constant and earnest prayer my
  soul can never be in health and prosper. . . . Felt particularly drawn out to pray for
  M'Cheyne that God would encourage his heart, which from his preaching on Thursday evening,
  seemed downcast, because of a supposed relapse of his people. God spare such a useful life
  long to labour amongst us ! </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, 10<sup>th</sup> May, 1841. Mr. M'Cheyne preached this forenoon from
    Hebrews v. 10-14. '<i>Called of God an High Priest after the order of Melchisedec, of whom
    we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered.</i>' &amp;c. Was much edified by the
    discourse to-day. 'We get on so slowly,' said M'Cheyne, 'because of so many unconverted
    people among us, and because there are so many who are only &quot;babes&quot; in Christ.
    We have to work again and again at the foundations&#151;the first principles of the
    oracles of God. Then there are so many Laodiceans, neither hot nor cold, among us ; so
    many Sardians, with a name to live and yet dead, that we are hindered from getting to
    higher things&#151;to the perfecting of the saints. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot; 'Again, we must not pass over &quot;hard&quot; things, though in the Bible, but
    read them with prayer and holy reverence, looking up to God for the enlightening influence
    of the Holy Ghost. How few come to the house of God to learn to become teachers of others!
    An old divine said, &quot;Art thou of use in the Church of Christ? Wouldst thou be missed
    if taken away? Hast thou taught any Christless neighbours, any poor ignorant
    children?&quot; People expect to be saved, and yet live useless lives, bearing the name of
    Christ and nothing more ; &quot;babes&quot; at St. Paul puts it, unskilled, untrained,
    like David in Saul's armour, not accustomed to it. Many do not <i>exercise</i> themselves.
    They cannot use the armour of righteousness when temptation assails them, or when trial
    and bereavement come. They have little skill in using the Gospel to heal themselves or
    others. What is the cause? &quot;Take heed&quot;, said Christ, &quot;how ye <i>hear</i>,&quot;
    for many are neither vessels of gold nor yet of silver, only cumberers in the Church of
    God.' &quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It was one of the characteristics of M'Cheyne that he was skilful in the selection of
  his texts as well as in the exposition of them. He &quot;sought to find out acceptable
  words&quot; in order that they might be as &quot;goads&quot; and &quot;nails,&quot;
  stimulating and strengthening. And one could not fail to see that he was looking up to the
  great Master of Assemblies to make them effective in applying the truth, as He alone
  could. This will appear from the texts quoted in Mr. Lamb's diary. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, 10<sup>th</sup> May, 1841. Mr. M'Cheyne preached in the afternoon from
    Ruth i., verses 13 and 14. His subject was <i>Ruth cleaving to Naomi</i>. Among other
    things, he said that Ruth's mother-in-law lost her husband and her two sons in quick
    succession. 'I went out full, and the Lord hath brought me home again empty.' This is
    often the case with the Lord's people. It makes their experience bitter and yet blessed.
    'Call me not Naomi (pleasant), call me Mara (bitter) ; for the Almighty hath dealt very
    bitterly with me.' Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and wept bitterly when it was
    said, 'Set thine house in order.' Job, when he lost his children and all his property, was
    so distressed that 'he cursed the day wherein he was born.' Such are the trials that come
    to God's people. But this manner of acting is to 'faint' under the Divine rebuke, and we
    are warned against that. Trouble is sent to wean God's people from the world, and to break
    the bonds of sin. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;It has been noticed that when a believer falls he often falls <i>very low</i>.
    See how David fell into adultery and murder. And when the believer thus falls, his love
    for prayer goes, while the Bible becomes a sealed book, written within and without with
    lamentation and woe. Afflictions are sent believers that they may know the hidden lusts of
    their hearts, and that they may mortify them. God can make a believer feel His presence,
    and He can also make him feel His absence. In Job xxiii. 5, 6 we have a case of real
    desertion ; and in Job xxix. 2-5 we have the enjoyment of the Divine presence. Here Mr.
    M'Cheyne appealed to his hearers as to whether they ever had any experience of this,
    whether they had ever felt such things. Those were in real danger who went on in the easy
    ways of the world. God cannot forget a soul that is in Christ. His love is compared to a
    mother's love. It is even more abiding. It is unchanging. 'I am God ; I change not.'
    Although believers may be afflicted and feel so sorrowful that they cannot say, 'I will
    praise the Lord, who is the health of my countenance and my God,' yet a time will come
    when they shall be able to sing that song. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, 31<sup>st</sup> May, 1841. Mr. M'Cheyne preached from Philippians iv. 6,
    '<i>Be careful for nothing ; but in everything by prayer and supplication, with
    thanksgiving, let your requests be made know unto God</i>.' It was a comforting discourse
    to every believer. Oh that I, as such, had more faith to feel this, and to trust in the
    Lord more fully ! Felt much 'joy and peace in believing' to-day, but I long to know more
    of the 'peace of God which passeth all understanding' that my heart and mind may be kept
    through Jesus Christ. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;A fast day was appointed by the General Assembly that we might humble ourselves
    as individuals and as a Church and nation, and pray that God might turn away His wrath
    from us, and revive us in His mercy. Mr. M'Cheyne officiated the whole day himself in St.
    Peter's, preaching from Ezekiel ix. 4 in the forenoon, 2 Corinthians ii. 14-16 in the
    afternoon, and Psalm cxxxix, 23, 24 in the evening. The last discourse in 'Searching' was
    impressive. '<i>Search me, O Lord, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts; and
    see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting</i>.' The text
    was applied to the sins of the individual members of the Church. Both in his prayers and
    preaching he was most comprehensive, earnest, and heart-searching in his allusions to the
    sins of Christians. The Lord bless the Word to all who heard it, and to my own soul, for
    how many of the truths he stated apply to myself! Indeed, it is my prayer to God that he
    would enable me to search and try my own heart, and know my thoughts, that I may be aware
    of the wicked ways that are in me, and pray to be led in the way everlasting.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>On another Sabbath in this year 1841, Mr. Lamb writes : &quot;Attended my place of
  worship as usual. In the forenoon Mr. M'Cheyne preached from Hebrews, on the 'Priesthood
  of Christ.' In the afternoon the text was Acts xii. 20, '<i>But the Word of God grew and
  multiplied</i>.' This sermon was a most impressive one. '<i>The Word of God grew</i>,' and
  where that was so the following results appeared in believers : a feeling as if a second
  conversion was required; more love for the sanctuary; a holier living, giving up even
  doubtful practices, pursuits, and pleasures, leaving the company of the wicked, and
  avoiding all occasions or temptations to fall into sin. On the other hand, if the Word of
  God is not growing and not multiplying, then Christians become cold or lukewarm&#151;
  Laodicean. Again, when the Word of God grows and multiplies, there are revivals of
  religion, notorious sinners are converted, and Christ's kingdom is advanced.&quot; </p>
  <p>In November of this year, 1841, Mr. Lamb had a German Jew with him. As was his custom,
  he brought the stranger within his gates to the house of God. He felt that he was so far
  responsible for all who came under his roof; that he was his brother's keeper, and that
  his neighbour was the man next to him. Accordingly he invited the foreigner to the church.
  He came, and was delighted with Mr. M'Cheyne's kind and affectionate manner of preaching.
  The good seed was sown which he believed would result in a blessed harvest. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, 20<sup>th</sup> February, 1842. Attended church as usual. Mr. M'Cheyne
    officiated the whole day. In the afternoon he preached a most impressive sermon on Job
    xiv. 1, 2 : '<i>Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh
    forth like a flower, and is cut down ; he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not</i>.'
    In confirmation of this truth he referred to the many sudden and painful bereavements
    which had recently occurred in the congregation. Both young and old&#151;the child and the
    old man of hoar hairs&#151;had been laid in the grave. These events were a commentary on
    the text, and one which we had every week, and would that we all laid the lesson of our
    mortality to heart. Here we have 'no continuing city.' At best we are but 'strangers and
    pilgrims.' </p>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, 24<sup>th</sup> April. Mr. M'Cheyne preached a very powerful and
    practical sermon from St. Mark's Gospel, xiv. 7, 8. '<i>She hath done what she could.</i>'
    These were the words of our Saviour with reference to Mary ; but they can be applied to
    all other Christians who seek to do what they can, in their several spheres, to promote
    the glory of God. Mary was a contemplative Christian, but she was practical as well.
    Indeed, Mr. M'Cheyne thought that the most pensive were often the most practical. To be
    contemplative merely is only to show the blossom and flower. We must be active too, and
    bring forth fruit, year, 'much fruit,' for by bearing fruit we glorify the Father. </p>
    <p>&quot;But what can Christians do now? We can love and pray more. We cannot, as Mary
    did, break a box of alabaster and anoint Christ's head with it. Nor was it to this our
    Saviour looked so much as to her broken heart and the flowing out of her affection for
    Him. </p>
    <p>&quot;Also, we can live holier lives, carry about with us a sweet fragrance, and
    endeavour to be consistent in our words, and looks, and lives. Let it be observable, by
    what we do, that we love Jesus. Yea, more, we can try to save the souls of others. Those
    who are saved by Christ must feel that others need salvation. Have we done what we could
    to save the perishing? </p>
    <p>&quot;And what are the <i>motives</i> that should impel us? Think what God has done for
    us, and how, before our conversion, we acted against Christ. Now, like Peter, let us say,
    that 'the time past of our life may suffice to have wrought the will of the Gentiles.' And
    let us remember that our works of faith and labours of love will not pass unrewarded. He
    shall acknowledge and honour us on the great day. 'Inasmuch as yet have done it unto one
    of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto me.' Oh that the dormant energies
    of all professing Christians were thus called forth, that at last it may be said of them,
    as of Mary, 'She hath done what she could!'&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Mr. M'Cheyne was fond of the Old Testament. It was manifestly to him a pleasant and
  fruitful field of research. He had no difficulty in finding the Gospel in it, almost
  everywhere, in type and symbol, as also illustrations and enforcements of Christian duty.
  Some preachers scarcely ever preach from the Old Testament Scriptures, which is apt to
  leave an impression on young minds that they are too difficult and dry, or that they are
  antiquated and obsolete. But that is far from the truth. The fact is, there are no
  writings more modern or up to date than the Old Testament Scriptures. There are no better
  illustrations of human nature to be found anywhere than in the book of Genesis. </p>
  <p>Of course, we rejoice in the New Testament. It is the outcome of the Old, the upper
  storey of the house, from which we have wider and clearer views. But it is one and the
  same house. </p>
  <p>That being Mr. M'Cheyne's view, he frequently went to the Old Testament for subjects of
  discourse, examples of which we give in the following extracts. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, 8<sup>th</sup> May, 1842. Mr. M'Cheyne preached in the afternoon from
    Zechariah iii. 1 : '<i>And he showed me Joshua the high priest, standing before the angel
    of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</i>' Here we have an
    example of how our great adversary continually seeks to resist believers. He is ever at
    their right hand, shooting his fiery darts, in the shape of infidel suggestions, or hard
    thoughts of one's self, or doubts concerning God's mercy, or inducements through the lust
    of the eye, the flesh, or the pride of life, and its pleasures, to sin against God. What
    believer is there that does not feel this to be his sad experience? And sometimes, alas!
    He sinks into some of the snares of the evil one. Nothing but the putting on, and keeping
    on, of the whole armour of God can enable us to quench these fiery darts, and this cause
    Satan to flee from us.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here Mr. Lamb tells his experience on the evening of this same day, that he had
  wonderful liberty and freedom from restraint in teaching his Bible class, as if somehow he
  had been shielded from all attacks and distractions from without. And there can be no
  doubt that the devil, or some one in his place, is particularly anxious to interfere with
  the comfort and usefulness of all preachers and teachers of the Word. Hence the necessity
  of being forearmed and on watch. </p>
  <p>From the following it will be seen that M'Cheyne adopted the symbolical or typical
  method common in Scottish pulpits then, but now falling rapidly into disuse. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;June 5<sup>th</sup>, 1842. '<i><strong>Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath
      hewn out her seven pillars</strong>,</i>' &amp;c. (Proverbs ix. 1-6). Wisdom may be taken
      to personify Christ. In the previous chapter it is spoken of thus: 'The Lord possessed Me
      in the beginning of His way, before His works of old.' This wisdom gives an invitation to
      sinners.</p>
      <p>&quot;(1.) She hath builded her house. We may take this house as meaning the Church of
      God. Christ builds that goodly temple. (See Hebrews iii.). He is 'a Son over His own
      house, whose house are we.' Just as King Solomon built his Temple, and his name means the
      Prince of Peace, so our King Jesus&#151;who also is the Price of Peace&#151;builds His.
      Moreover he quarries out and carves every stone and lays it in his place. He superintends
      that building. He wishes us to be stones of His temple. As the structure rises joyful
      shoutings are heard: 'Grace, grace, unto it.' No sand foundation is here; no edifice that
      endures but for a little. 'For we know that of our earthly house of this tabernacle were
      dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the
      heavens.' </p>
      <p>&quot;(2.) The seven pillars may represent eminent believers. They are needful to hold
      the building together. James and John and Cephas were thus pillars of the Church
      (Galatians ii. 9). And in Revelation iii. 12 it is said, 'Him that overcometh will I make
      a pillar in the temple of My God.' The number seven carries with it the idea of
      perfection. Christ fashions them gloriously, He hews out His pillars. </p>
      <p>&quot;(3.) Then Wisdom invites us to a feast. 'She hath killed her beasts.' Christ has
      made the great sacrifice for us. 'She hath mingled her wine.' The Holy Spirit is as wine,
      yet not as the wine of this world. 'Be ye not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be
      filled with the Spirit.' 'She hath also furnished her table.' The sacrifice and the Holy
      Spirit lie there for us; they nourish us. So we <i>live</i>. Sin's death-power over us is
      destroyed. </p>
      <p>&quot;(4.) Messengers are sent out. 'Her maidens' go forth with the invitations. <i>Weak</i>
      vessels. So Christ uses such that all the glory may be in Him. Holy they are&#151;chaste,
      pure. So Christ's ministers. Weak vessels indeed, but they must be holy. A bishop must be
      holy and blameless. Ah, ministers require much to be prayed for&#151;they <i>are</i>
      Christ's witnesses&#151;His standard-bearers,&#151;have their commission from Him, and the
      devil likes to attack them. This arch-enemy says to his followers, 'Fight not with small
      or great, but with these.' . . . Wisdom 'crieth upon the highest places of the city.'
      Verily so did Christ. </p>
      <p>&quot;Notice who are invited. The 'simple&#151;him that wanteth understanding.' She
      must arrest the attention of the foolish. 'A prudent man foreseeth the evil, . . but the
      simple pass on, and are punished.' Forsake your folly and live. The companions of the
      foolish shall be destroyed. If we will only think we will not turn away from the great
      salvation God offers us. 'Come,' says Wisdom, 'eat of my bread and drink of the wine which
      I have mingled.' Partake, or no benefit will come to you. 'The Bread of God is He which
      cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. He that cometh to me,' says
      Jesus, 'shall never hunger, and he that believeth in Me shall never thirst.'&quot; </p>
      <hr>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, 22<sup>nd</sup> May, 1842. Mr. M'Cheyne preached to-day on <i>Caleb
    following the Lord fully</i>. It was a very practical and edifying discourse. How few
    believers, indeed, follow the Lord fully! How inconsistencies prevent this, and make them
    stumbling-blocks to others! I greatly enjoyed the sermon, and felt that I could take not a
    little of it to myself. May the Lord enable me to follow Him more fully than ever! Take
    away every hindrance, subdue mine iniquities, and keep my heart.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Such searchings and humblings of heart on the part of hearers are sure signs that the
  preaching is if the right sort, quick and powerful, and leading to the cultivation of a
  holier life. May the King send more ambassadors of this sort! </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Thursday, 1<sup>st</sup> December, 1842. A day of thanksgiving for the late
    abundant harvest. Mr. M'Cheyne officiated all day. In the forenoon he preached from
    Nehemiah viii. 9, 10: '<i>And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha (governor), and Ezra the
    priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This
    day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when
    they heard the words of the law,</i>' &amp;c. The opening prayer was based on the greater
    part of the 148<sup>th</sup> psalm, and was most appropriate throughout. Truly he was
    enabled to pray in the Spirit in a particular manner. Then his preaching came with such
    power. He dwelt especially on the closing words of the 10<sup>th</sup> verse, 'the joy of
    the Lord is your strength,' showing that when the Christian has great joy in the Lord from
    believing, he gets strength for every duty and trial. </p>
    <p>&quot;In the afternoon the subject was continued, and was felt to be exceedingly
    comforting and strengthening. He said,&#151;(1.) The joy of the Lord was not animal,
    carnal nor merely 'innocent' joy. It was spiritual, and the portion of the believer. (2.)
    It came to us from Christ. Such was the Ethiopian treasurer's joy, such was the Philippian
    jailor's joy. (3.) It continued in us through the Holy Ghost. And just as natural joy
    upholds us and gives strength to us, so with this spiritual joy. It shall be manifest to
    others, and we shall invite others to share in it. 'Eat the fat and drink the sweet, and
    send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared.' Note further (1.) Christ Jesus had
    that spiritual joy. He was a Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, yet He had joy in
    His soul which made Him strong. He 'rejoiced in spirit.' For 'the joy that was set before
    Him' He endured. (2.) Paul also had much of this joy. He speaks of it, and again and again
    one sees it in him. (3.) All faithful ministers have this joy. They suffer much, it is
    true. So they can comfort broken hearts. But when ministers allow sin to lie on their
    consciences, the spiritual joy leaves them, and they are weak. When God's Word to them too
    is a sealed book&#151;when they read it not in the Spirit&#151;know not its contents for
    their souls&#151;then their sermons have no joyous life in them. Take away the comfort
    that 'the joy of the Lord' gives us, and we are as Samson when his locks were shorn.&quot;
    Mr. M'Cheyne then referred to suffering for the right&#151;for the Lord's cause&#151;and
    said, &quot;I read my Bible ill of such sufferings as the martyrs suffered are not coming
    now, but, as with Stephen, the 'joy of the Lord' will hold up the sufferers.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Sabbath, 18<sup>th</sup> December, 1842. Mr. M'Cheyne preached to-day from
    Hebrews ii. 3 :<i> 'How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?</i>' It was a
    solemn and searching sermon. What a terrible guilt lies at the door of those who hear the
    Gospel, and yet fail to accept its gracious invitations! We need only to <i>neglect</i>
    what is offered, to perish, and go down to a lost eternity. Who can answer the question of
    the text? </p>
    <p>&quot;In the evening I had much liberty in teaching and speaking seriously to the
    children in the Sabbath school. Oh that some may be brought, through my instrumentality,
    to a knowledge of Jesus Christ! One soul led by me to find 'the pearl of great price'
    would far more than compensate for all my nights of teaching and praying with and for
    them. </p>
    <p>&quot;What a lovely starry night! The moon and stars are shining on the river, and as
    seen from my window the whole scene is enchanting. I thought on the greatness of God, and
    what a lack of faith I often showed in not trusting Him who is almighty to make all
    needful provision for me in this life and that which is to come. How should I doubt or
    fear when I consider Him who made the heavens and the earth, the sun, moon, and stars, and
    upholds them all? Why question either His willingness or ability to supply all my wants?
    Read my Bible, and retired to rest.&quot; </p>

  <p>In addition to these reports of sermons, Mr. Lamb has many references in the diary to
  important ecclesiastical events that were then transpiring in Scotland. He tells us, for
  instance, of the &quot;Church Defence&quot; meetings&#151;for so he calls them&#151;that
  were held by the St. Peter's people; of the detailed account M'Cheyne gave of the
  Convocation held in Edinburgh in November, 1842; of the resolution of the members and
  office-bearers to &quot;come out,&quot; if separation from the State were necessary; of
  his own going to Edinburgh as a member of the General Assembly of 1843, and attending the
  preliminary conference in St. Luke's Church on the Tuesday and Wednesday; of his being
  present in St. Andrew's Church on the Thursday when the Disruption took place; and of his
  going to hear Dr. Candlish on the following Sabbath in his &quot;new church, the first
  Free Presbyterian Church in which worship was performed,&quot; when a magnificent sermon
  was preached from St. Matthew v. 16, &quot;Let your light so shine before men, that they
  may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is heaven.&quot; It would be
  interesting to quote some of these entries, but they go beyond the scope of this book. It
  may be remarked here, however, that Mr. Lamb, in addition to the diary, kept little
  note-books in which there are many jottings on those events. But in these little
  note-books&#151;written in pencil&#151; there are also many notes of sermons and
  expositions of Scripture by M'Cheyne which do not appear in the diary. Let us cull from
  them some <i>M'Cheyniana</i>. </p>

      <p><strong><i>The Transfiguration</i></strong>. &quot;There are great deeps here that pass
      knowledge, just like the agony in Gethsemane.&quot; &quot;In the Church of Christ there
      are some who are not only of the twelve, but of the three&#151;men who are not only
      believers, but eminent believers&#151;men who are specially near to God. It is good to be
      among the twelve, but better to be among the three<i>. Covet earnestly the best gifts</i>.&quot;
      &quot;Christ loved solitary places, but also the prayer <i>meeting</i>.&quot; &quot;Moses
      and Elias appearing unto Him&#151;to talk with Him about his decease at Jerusalem&#151;was
      an answer to the prayer ' that those whom the Father had given Him might be one with Him,
      and behold His glory.'&quot; </p>

      <p><strong><i>Prayer</i>.</strong> &quot;Pray without ceasing.&quot; Have a <i>prayerful
      spirit</i>. Have stated times for prayer. Daniel and David had such. In <i>everything</i>
      by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
      Strange that some <i>Christians</i> should only pray in great emergencies&#151;at a
      death-bed, say, or under some great trial. We should lay <i>all</i> matters before God.
      Nothing is too little to lay before God. Not a sparrow falls to the ground without His
      knowledge&#151;unless it be His will.&quot; </p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong><i>A Believer's Fall</i>.</strong> &quot;Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai,
      not to the voice of God. Our errors arise just from taking counsel with flesh and blood.
      Here, then, Abram falls after he has been a believer for 110 years. Ah, but how many fall
      after only 10 years!&quot; </p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong><i>Keeping under the Body</i></strong>. &quot;How particular Paul was in
      keeping under his body! Satan gets a great advantage over Christians when they are
      intemperate in eating, in drinking, in sleeping. Paul felt that if he lived after the
      flesh he would simply die&#151;that all his work for Christ, all his spiritual experiences
      and attainments would go for nothing&#151;and that life then was really not worth living.
      More, he would come into terrible condemnation. God would cast him away.&quot; </p>
      <hr>
      <p><a href="../castaway.htm"><strong><i>A Castaway</i></strong></a>. &quot;The word
      'castaway' seems to be connected with the melting of metals. It is that which is thrown
      out, and is worse than useless. A chosen one like Paul, then, if&#151;because of continued
      sinning&#151;rejected by God, is as <i>castaway</i>, thrown-out, reprobate silver.&quot; </p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong><i>Our Lord's Temptation</i></strong>. &quot;He was tempted in a fourfold way
      to distrust, presumption, idolatry, ambition.&quot; </p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong><i>Possessed of Devils</i></strong>. &quot;The unconverted are like such. They
      dwell in the tomb. Their abode is as the grave&#151;no mention of God's name there, no
      praise ascending to God. And their surroundings are corrupt as the place where dead bodies
      are.&quot; . . . &quot;As with these devils, who can 'tame' the unconverted; the pride of
      the proud man; they eye of the adulterer; the foot of the drunkard as he crosses the
      threshold of the tavern? Many hands are stretched out to 'tame,' to 'bind' the sinner:
      parental authority; an earnest minister's warnings and entreaties. All these, however,
      fail to lay hold of a Christless man when the flood of temptation and sin rises in his
      bosom. It is just like trying to bind the legions spoken of in the Gospels. Christ alone
      can change his nature. He <i>clothes</i> him and puts him in <i>his right mind</i>. At
      once he leaves the tomb and the company of the filthy and corrupt.</p>
